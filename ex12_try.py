#Write an algorithm that reads two floating values (x and y), which should represent the coordinates of a point in a plane. Next, determine which quadrant the point belongs, or if you are at one of the Cartesian axes or the origin (x = y = 0).



#If the point is at the origin, write the message "Origem".

#If the point is at X axis write "Eixo X", else if the point is at Y axis write "Eixo Y".

#Input
#The input contains the coordinates of a point.

#Output
#The output should display the quadrant in which the point is.
