Basics about variables:

A variable is made up of two parts: its name and its value.

Assigning a value to a variable is called an assignment.

The value of a variable can be changed.

The type of a variable depends on its value.

The names of your variables should be clear, explicit, and should follow a typographic convention.

Three primitive types of variables, essential to all programs/analyses:

Integers (int)

Decimals (float)

Character strings (string)

You have also seen how to use these different types:

You can perform numeric operations on numeric variables of different types.

You can cast variables to force the transformation of the type of a variable into another specific type, according to your needs.

Strings can be assembled together: this is called concatenation.

There are many pre-existing functions in Python! In addition to those already seen, there are, for example:

len() :  a function that returns the length of an item. Do you remember strings? Using this function on a string tells you how many characters the string contains.

type() : lets you print the type of a variable.

pow(a, b) : lets you calculate a to the power of b. It is equivalent to writing a**b.

abs() :  returns the absolute value of a number.
