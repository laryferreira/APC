#This is a reminder that you cannot concatenate other types of variables with strings, such as numeric variables---this would return an error.
#You have seen that the operator   +  can have different purposes depending on the types of variables you work with: With numeric types, 
#it is used to add.
#With strings, it is used to concatenate.
